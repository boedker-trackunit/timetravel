# Practice Safe Time travel
Traveling safe, and allow for experimentation  - when all else fails - reflog can get you home

Safety tips:

1. Donâ€™t change history for shared (remote) branches.
2. Set up an editor that you like/know well for git operations
3. When rebasing or cherry-picking - small steeps - Do one thing at a time - until you are used to resolve conflicts
4. Use a separate branch for rebasing a feature
5. Save the game before a boss fight `git branch safegame -f` so you have a place to go back to if everything blows up
6. If all else fails - use reflog and reset to get back to safety

```
$ git reflog 
```
shows you EVERYTHING that has happened in the current repo on your machine

```

```

and you can do a reset to any point 

```
$ git reset --hard 83b7648
```

and now EVERYTHING after (above) this commit never happened...
